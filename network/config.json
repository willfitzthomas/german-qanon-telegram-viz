The number of forwards from other channels were tallied, and the top-5-most-forwarded channels were included as the secondary nodes.\n\nThe process was repeated to create a list of tertiary nodes. The forwards from other channels/groups into the tertiary nodes were tallied and included as edges as well. ",
